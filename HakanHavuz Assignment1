Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?

DBMS is a database program, Databases can handle large amounts of data that cannot be managed in a spreadsheet.
The reasons why we need DBMS:
1-Computers Can Quickly Answer Lots of Questions. 
2- Some questions can be really hard to calculate.
3- We Are Easily Overwhelmed With Information so database management system takes over this burden.
4- Data environments are comprised of data, hardware, software, people and procedures. The advantages of using databases have been espoused by many, and can be tagged to
particular characteristics of the DBMS.
For instance, while Excel spreadsheets and Access databases are generally used by only one person, true database management systems allow for the simultaneous access of 
multiple users. A database is a single software application that may use many tables, forms and reports, rather than a plethora of spreadsheets owned and managed by people 
throughout the organization.
5-With these all the cost of every work or the time you spend while working reduces a lot. So you can save money.
6- Preventing and efficiently identifying data errors in spreadsheets is harder than databases.

The disadvantages i found is:
1- For some ppl using DBMS is can be complicated.
2- You need to know about techonology
